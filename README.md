## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Streamlit
- **Backend:** Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)
- **Preprocessing:** StandardScaler
- **Language:** Python 3.8+

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation.git
cd crop-recommendation
````

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
```

### 3️⃣ Run the App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

> Open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Users input the soil and weather parameters.
2. Data is preprocessed using a saved `StandardScaler`.
3. A pre-trained **Random Forest** model predicts the best crop.
4. The original crop name is displayed (not just a number!).
5. Includes emoji 🌽🌾🍇🍉 for a fun experience!
